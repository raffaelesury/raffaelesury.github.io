# This is a sample page

Content.


```
Useful to display terminal output
```

In-line commands can be written like this `Hello, World!`.

Lists: 

 1. uno
 2. due
 3. tre

Weird spacing.

- uno
- due

Fool-proof way to insert easy-to-read code: use gists, use the appropriate file extension to get the correct highlighting
{% gist 565e242be6f8a411be2d242f53b7d1de %}


This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].
Add more space with some br

<br><br>

The end.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Some *crazy* footnote definition.

[^footnote]: Another footnote 'hi'.
